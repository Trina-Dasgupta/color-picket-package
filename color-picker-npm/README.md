### Notes:
1. **Markdown Formatting**: By specifying the language after the triple backticks, such as `jsx` or `bash`, GitHub renders the code with appropriate syntax highlighting.
2. **Maintain Readability**: Write in a structured way so itâ€™s easy for others to follow.
3. **Test Display**: After writing, you can preview your `README.md` in your repository to verify the layout and appearance.
